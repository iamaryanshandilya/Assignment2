Web console is a tool which is mainly used to log information associated
with a web page.
In javascript, console is an object used to access the browser's debugging tool.
To open the web console in different Operating Systems, we need to do the following:

For Windows 10, Ctrl + Shift + K
For OS X , we do Command + K



(i) console.log() = It is basically used to print something on the console, the monitor
, it can be anything string, array, object, boolean, etc.
For eg:
    console.log("Aryan"); - Will print Aryan on the console.

(ii) console.error - It is used to print some error message on the console.
                    By default, that error message will be highlighted in red color.

For eg:
    console.error("This is an error message"); - will print an error message in red color.


(iii) console.warn() - This is used to print a warning message on the output screen
                        , by default the warning message will be in yellow color.

For eg:
    console.warn("This is a warning message")

(iv) console.clear() - Used to clear the console.
For eg:
    console.clear(); - This will clear the console.

(v) console.time() and console.timeEnd() - Whenever we want to know the amount of time spend by a block or a
         function, we can make use of the time() and timeEnd() methods provided by the javascript console object. 
         They take a label which must be same, and the code inside can be anything( function, object, simple console).

For eg:
// console.time() and console.timeEnd() method  
console.time('abc'); 
 let fun =  function(){ 
     console.log('fun is running'); 
 } 
 let fun2 = function(){ 
     console.log('fun2 is running..'); 
 } 
 fun(); // calling fun(); 
 fun2(); // calling fun2(); 
console.timeEnd('abc');
