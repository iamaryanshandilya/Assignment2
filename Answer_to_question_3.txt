Definition of data type - Data types describe the different types or kinds of 
                          data that we’re gonna be working with and storing in variables.


 Strings are collections of alphanumeric characters and symbols.We use them to store letters and words.

 Numbers are just what they sound like. They’re numbers, including both integers and decimals.
  Computers will often use numbers to perform mathematical operations,
   but they may also just be a number like a count of how many flavors of ice cream a particular store has.

Booleans can only have two values. True and false. They represent all data that only has two states, like a light switch. On or off. 

The undefined data type means that the variable has been created,
 but has never been given a value. It is nothing because no one has ever bothered to tell it what value it should be. 

 Null is similar to undefined, except it has to be set intentionally.
  It also means empty or nothing, but it’s that way because a developer told it it was empty or nothing.
